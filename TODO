1. Task Management (Scheduler):

  - Task creation, scheduling, and execution.
  - Priority-based scheduling, round-robin scheduling, etc.
  - Task synchronization and communication mechanisms (semaphores, mutexes, message queues).

2. Memory Management:

  - Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation (heap management).
  - Memory protection and memory partitioning for safety-critical applications.

3. Interrupt Handling:

  - Handling of hardware interrupts and exceptions.
  - Real-time response to time-critical events.
    - TODO: Create "enter critical area" functionality

4. Timer and Time Management:

  - System timer management for task scheduling and timing operations.
    - Determine scheduler timer inteface required
  - Accurate timekeeping and timestamping.
    - Add OS time

5. Device I/O Management:

  - Abstraction of device drivers for peripheral communication (UART, SPI, I2C, etc.).
  - Device management and configuration.

6. Inter-Process Communication (IPC):

  - Mechanisms for communication between tasks and processes.
  - Shared memory, message passing, event signaling.

7. File System (Optional):

  - File I/O operations for persistent data storage.
  - Support for various file systems (FAT, FAT32, etc.).

8. Networking (Optional):

  - TCP/IP stack implementation for networked applications.
  - Socket API support for communication over Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.

9. Power Management (Optional):

  - Power-saving features for energy-efficient operation.
  - Support for low-power modes and wakeup sources.

10. Debugging and Diagnostics:

  - Runtime monitoring and debugging features.
  - Logging, traceability, and error reporting mechanisms.
    - Add failure trap loop
    - Add scratch register based traceability

11. Security (Optional):

  - Access control mechanisms.
  - Cryptographic protocols and secure communication channels.

12. Configuration and Initialization:

  - Boot sequence and system initialization routines.
  - Configuration of system parameters and resources.

13. User templates

  - Commonly used SWC templates
